# Rental_Singapore
This is an intellectual database of the Rental and Transportation information of Singapore, it has the functions of finding the route between MRT stations, property units and some landmarks. 


The intelligent function

Function 1: Display the shortest route by MRT from a Property_unit to NTU. In order to realize the function, we need to plot the route from one MRT station to another, and then sum up the number of MRT segments along the route. Then we need to sort them and get the shortest three from an HDB block to another block by the closest MRT station. 

Function 2: Find the route from a landmark to a Property_unit or another landmark. In order to realize the function, we need to create nodes of the landmarks and create relationships between them to the closest MRT_station. Then we will be able to find the shortest route using queries.
